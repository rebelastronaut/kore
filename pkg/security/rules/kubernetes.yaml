- name: Auth Proxy IP Ranges

    ## Overview

    This rule checks the network filters on the authentication proxy.

    ## Details

    When Kore creates a Kubernetes cluster, it uses an authentication proxy
    running inside that cluster to authenticate access to the cluster. It is
    best practice to restrict the IP address ranges enabled by default on a
    cluster to a known set of IP ranges.

    ## Impact

    The authentication proxy deployed is secure to be open to the internet,
    so if necessary it is acceptable to run clusters without restricting the
    range. However, where possible, the range should be restricted to those IP
    ranges where your administrators will access the cluster from.

  rule: |
    package security

    default msg = "All ranges specified checked and compliant"

    plan[msg] {
      input.kind == "Plan"
      input.spec.configuration.authProxyAllowedIPs[_] = "0.0.0.0/0"
      msg := "Authentication Proxy permitted is network range open on plan"
    }

    cluster[msg] {
      input.kind == "Cluster"
      input.spec.configuration.authProxyAllowedIPs[_] = "0.0.0.0/0"
      msg := "Authentication Proxy permitted is network range open on cluster"
    }

- name: Default Team Role
  code: KUBE_ROLES-01
  status: warning
  description: |
    ## Overview

    This rule checks if default team role on the cluster gives too much away.

    ## Details

    The default team role which is inherited by all users to seems very loose
    and is giving a cluster admin to all team members

    ## Impact

    The default privileges of the team member is very high, we'd suggest
    changing to 'view'

  rule: |
    package security

    default msg = "Default team role on recommended setting"

    plan[msg] {
      input.kind == "Plan"
      role := input.spec.configuration.defaultTeamRole
      role != "view"
      msg := "Default team role not recommended 'view' role"
    }
