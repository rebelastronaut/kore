Profiles provide a means to store, configure and switch between multiple
Kore instances from a single configuration. Alternatively, you might
use profiles to use different identities (i.e. admin / user) to a single
instance. These are automatically created for you via the $ kore login
command or you can manually configure them via the $ kore profile configure.
